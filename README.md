How to draw with a laser
I saw very interesing video on tiktok, where guy draw with laser in his hands. I didn't find an open source code on the Internet, so I wrote my own
That pet-project have some bags,but don't know when I will fix them
Some ideas to do this project better:
1. Connect with projector and display a picture(canvas) on wall,so you can drow something not only on computer
2. stop using webcam and connect wi-fi camera or similar

also I had only powerful laser,that mean HSV settings for white color, so you can try it without laser, just something bright like flashlight on phone
